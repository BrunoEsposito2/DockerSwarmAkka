# Public API: Akka Cluster Docker Compose Configuration
# 
# This file defines the public deployment interface for the Akka cluster.
# Changes to service names, exposed ports, or required environment variables
# constitute breaking changes requiring a MAJOR version bump according to
# Semantic Versioning.
#
# API Surface:
# - Service names: worker1, worker2
# - Exposed ports: 2555 (worker1), 2551 (worker2) 
# - Required environment variables: JOIN_TOKEN, MANAGER_IP
# - Network name: swarm-network

services:
  # Public API: Primary cluster node service
  # Breaking changes: service name change, port mapping changes
  worker1:
    build:
      context: ./node1/
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    privileged: true
    container_name: worker1
    # Public API: Akka remoting port for primary node
    # Port 2555 is the canonical port for worker1 cluster communication
    # Changing this port breaks cluster formation - requires MAJOR version bump
    ports:
      - "2555:2555"
    # Public API: Required environment variables for cluster deployment
    # These variables must be provided for successful cluster formation
    environment:
      # Docker Swarm join token - required for swarm node joining
      - JOIN_TOKEN=${JOIN_TOKEN}
      # Docker Swarm manager IP address - required for swarm communication  
      - MANAGER_IP=${MANAGER_IP}
    volumes:
      - worker1-certs:/certs
    # Public API: Cluster overlay network
    # Network name 'swarm-network' is part of deployment interface
    # Changing network name breaks inter-service communication
    networks:
      - swarm-network

  # Public API: Secondary cluster node service  
  # Breaking changes: service name change, port mapping changes
  worker2:
    build:
      context: ./node2/
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    privileged: true
    container_name: worker2
    # Public API: Akka remoting port for secondary node
    # Port 2551 is the canonical port for worker2 cluster communication
    # Changing this port breaks cluster formation - requires MAJOR version bump
    ports:
      - "2551:2551"
    # Public API: Required environment variables (same as worker1)
    environment:
      - JOIN_TOKEN=${JOIN_TOKEN}
      - MANAGER_IP=${MANAGER_IP}
    volumes:
      - worker2-certs:/certs
    networks:
      - swarm-network

volumes:
  # Internal volumes - not part of public API
  worker1-certs:
  worker2-certs:

# Public API: Docker overlay network for cluster communication
# Network configuration is part of the deployment interface
# Driver and attachable settings ensure proper cluster connectivity
